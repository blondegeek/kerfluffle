            "title": "A Primer on Spherical Harmonic Projections for Atomic Environments",
            "content": "The aim of this post is give give some examples of spherical harmonic projections to play with to build intuition about why spherical harmonics are so helpful for describing atomic environments. . Spherical harmonics are the basis functions for signals on the sphere ($S^2$) . Below we&#39;ll plot the real spherical harmonics as 3D Surface plots where the magnitude of the signal is the radial distance of the point of the surface from the origin. In this plot, Yellow signifies positive values and Blue signifies negative values. . . Spherical harmonics are great for describing local atomic environments . Why? Atoms don’t like to be too close to each other — they tend to spread themselves evenly across the sphere when coordinating a central atom. This means that we don’t need to go to high in spherical harmonic order to capture a local environment. We only need high L to differentiate between two points that are close together in angle. . To demonstrate this, we plot the spherical harmonic projection of two vectors with angle $ theta$ between them with $L_{max} = 4$. We will see that the needed $L$ to achieve a good angular resolution is $L approx 2 pi / text{minimum angle}$. . As the minimum angle approaches zero $L rightarrow infty$, but practically, the angles between triplets of atoms rarely come close to this and $L_{max} = 6 - 10$ is often sufficient, especially when using radial basis functions (to account for radial degrees of freedom) with spherical harmonics describing the angular degrees of freedom. . Many coefficients become zero for objects with symmetry . Another time when we need higher L is when we have high symmetry. For example, you can’t represent n-fold symmetry with lower than L=n. In the example below, we&#39;ll see that high symmetry configurations like the vertices of a tetrahedron or octahedron. . Plotting the value of spherical harmonic coefficents are a quick way to see where zeros are occuring . Another way to examine this data is the plot the coefficients associated with each of the spherical harmonics. In this plot the y-axis indicates the different configurations and the x-axis indicates the L and m of each $(L_{max} + 1)^2$ coefficents. As we will see, many of these coefficients are zero, matching the lack of features for some of the plots above. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
