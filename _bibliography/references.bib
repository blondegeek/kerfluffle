                   useful topics from the theory of special functions, in
                   particular the spherical harmonics and Legendre polynomials
                   for any dimension, available to undergraduates studying
                   physics or mathematics. With this audience in mind, nearly
                   all details of the calculations and proofs are written out,
                   and extensive background material is covered before
                   beginning the main subject matter. The reader is assumed to
                   have knowledge of multivariable calculus and linear algebra
                   as well as some level of comfort with reading proofs.",

  author        = "Geiger, Mario and Smidt, Tess",
  abstract      = "We present e3nn, a generalized framework for creating E(3)
                   equivariant trainable functions, also known as Euclidean
                   neural networks. e3nn naturally operates on geometry and
                   geometric tensors that describe systems in 3D and transform
                   predictably under a change of coordinate system. The core of
                   e3nn are equivariant operations such as the TensorProduct
                   class or the spherical harmonics functions that can be
                   composed to create more complex modules such as convolutions
                   and attention mechanisms. These core operations of e3nn can
                   be used to efficiently articulate Tensor Field Networks, 3D
                   Steerable CNNs, Clebsch-Gordan Networks, SE(3) Transformers
                   and other E(3) equivariant networks.",
